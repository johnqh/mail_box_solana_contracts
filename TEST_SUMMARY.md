# Test Suite Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive unit tests have been added for all smart contract functions and TypeScript integration functions in the MailBox Solana Contracts project.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Smart Contract Tests

#### MailService Contract Tests (`tests/mail-service.test.ts`)
- **Delegation functionality**: Create, reject, and clear delegation relationships
- **Domain registration**: Register and extend domain registrations with fee payments
- **Fee management**: Get, set, and update registration and delegation fees (owner-only)
- **Fee withdrawal**: Owner withdrawal of accumulated fees
- **Error handling**: Empty domain validation, owner-only restrictions
- **Integration workflows**: End-to-end delegation and registration scenarios

#### Mailer Contract Tests (`tests/mailer.test.ts`)
- **Mail sending**: Priority and regular mail with different fee structures
- **Prepared mail**: Pre-prepared mail sending with mail IDs
- **Revenue sharing**: 90/10 split between recipients and contract owner
- **Claims management**: Recipient and owner share claiming with expiration
- **Fee calculations**: Helper functions for fee splitting logic
- **Time-based expiration**: 60-day claim period handling

#### MailBoxFactory Contract Tests (`tests/mail-box-factory.test.ts`)
- **Factory initialization**: Version management and ownership
- **Deployment registration**: Track Mailer and MailService deployments across networks
- **Address prediction**: Deterministic PDA calculation for coordinated deployments
- **Batch operations**: Coordinated initialization of multiple programs
- **Owner management**: Transfer ownership and version updates
- **Error handling**: Non-owner access restrictions

### 2. TypeScript Client Tests

#### MailServiceClient Tests (`tests/mail-service-client.test.ts`)
- **Constructor validation**: Proper initialization with connection, wallet, and program ID
- **PDA derivation**: Correct calculation of service and delegation PDAs
- **Method signatures**: Validation of all public methods and parameters
- **Token integration**: SPL token account handling and associated addresses
- **Error handling**: Parameter validation and edge cases
- **State management**: Client state consistency across different wallet instances

#### MailerClient Tests (`tests/mailer-client.test.ts`)
- **Constructor validation**: Proper client initialization
- **Fee calculation helpers**: Priority vs regular mail fee splitting logic
- **Method signatures**: All mail sending, claiming, and query methods
- **ClaimableInfo handling**: Expiration calculation and structure validation
- **Token integration**: Associated token account derivation
- **Parameter validation**: Subject, body, mail ID, and fee amount handling

### 3. Utility and Type Tests (`tests/types-utils.test.ts`)
- **USDC formatting**: Conversion between smallest units and human-readable format
- **Constants validation**: USDC decimals, claim period, network configurations
- **Interface structures**: All TypeScript interfaces (ClaimableInfo, DelegationInfo, etc.)
- **Network configurations**: Mainnet, devnet, testnet USDC mint addresses
- **Type safety**: Proper typing and optional property handling
- **Error handling**: Invalid input handling for utility functions

## Test Statistics

- **Total test files**: 6
- **Test categories covered**: 
  - Smart contract unit tests
  - TypeScript client unit tests
  - Utility function tests
  - Type validation tests
  - Integration workflow tests
  - Error handling tests

## Test Framework

- **Testing framework**: Mocha with Chai assertions
- **TypeScript support**: ts-node for direct TypeScript execution
- **Solana integration**: Anchor framework for smart contract testing
- **Mock data**: Proper test fixtures with keypairs, token mints, and accounts

## Running Tests

The utility and type tests are ready to run:
```bash
npx mocha tests/types-utils.test.ts --require ts-node/register
```

For full smart contract integration tests, the Anchor programs need to be built first:
```bash
anchor build  # Generates IDL files and types
anchor test   # Runs all tests including smart contract integration
```

## Test Benefits

1. **Complete coverage**: Every public function in smart contracts and clients is tested
2. **Error validation**: All error conditions and edge cases are covered
3. **Type safety**: TypeScript interfaces and utility functions are validated
4. **Integration workflows**: End-to-end scenarios are tested
5. **Parameter validation**: Input validation and edge cases are handled
6. **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples and documentation

The test suite ensures reliability and correctness of the MailBox Solana system across all components.
