- **Integration Workflows**: End-to-end scenarios covered
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript validation
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples

## 🚀 Next Steps for Full Integration

To run the smart contract integration tests, you'll need:

1. **Install Anchor Framework**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @project-serum/anchor-cli
   ```

2. **Build Programs**:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

3. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```
